                        Hi! How are you? I hope you're doing well. This is your pen pal Mateo writing from Medellín, where I’m studying software programming at SENA. I attend classes Monday through Friday, from 12 PM to 6 PM, at the Salazar y Herrera campus near the Atanasio Girardot stadium. The experience has been great; I’ve made new friends and strengthened my skills to start working as a programmer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        The program is divided into two stages: the academic stage and the practical stage. The academic stage has three trimesters of about two and a half months each, and the practical stage lasts around six months. The first trimester was one of my favorites because I met new people and learned a lot of technical concepts, like SQL and the C# programming language. In the second trimester, we worked on graphical interfaces, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Windows Forms.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        People in Medellín are very friendly. They always smile and help us when we need something. I like the way they speak and how calm they are. I feel safe and happy here. I am also learning some local words in Spanish, and it is fun! Every day I discover something new about this place.
                    </p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        Right now, I’m working on a web project with some friends called Viajes Nova. I’m proud of our progress, and as a programmer, I’m always finding more efficient ways to do things.
